Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis with WPS Spreadsheet                                                                                                                                           
This project uses a transactional dataset from a fictional coffee shop to perform an end-to-end sales analysis. The objective is to leverage data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques in WPS Spreadsheet to identify key sales trends, evaluate product performance, and compare store locations. The analysis provides actionable insights to help optimize business performance and enhance customer experience.

***Problem Statement***:                                                                                                                                                                            
Analyze a transactional sales dataset to build an interactive dashboard in WPS Spreadsheet.

***Methodology***:                                                                                                                                                                           
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Performed data cleaning, including removing duplicates, handling empty values, and formatting data types. Used WPS functions like TRIMandPROPER to standardize text fields.                                                                                                                                                                            
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized WPS pivot tables to summarize sales data by product, month, and location.                                                                     
3. **Data Visualization**: Created a dynamic, interactive dashboard in WPS Spreadsheet using various charts (bar, line) and slicers to visualize key insights.                                        
4. **Key Findings**: Extracted actionable insights from the visualizations, such as identifying the top-performing products, analyzing monthly sales trends, and comparing sales across different stores.
